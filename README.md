# IPL-Match-and-Performance-Analysis-Power-BI

Thrilled to share my latest data analytics project: a comprehensive **Power BI Dashboard** on the Indian Premier League (IPL)! I've analyzed data from the 2021, 2022, and 2023 seasons to uncover some exciting trends and player insights.

This project was a great way to showcase skills in data visualization, using **Power Query** for data transformation and **DAX** for creating powerful measures.

Here are some highlights from the dashboard:

* **Overview Page:** A high-level summary of each season, including champions, runners-up, Orange Cap, Purple Cap, and MVP winners. It's great to see the dominance of teams like Chennai Super Kings and Gujarat Titans.
* **Player Profile Page:** A dedicated, interactive page that allows you to select any player and view their detailed performance stats. You can dive deep into metrics like runs scored, wickets taken, strike rate, and economy rate to see how top players like Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah, and others performed across the seasons.
* **Batting & Bowling Analysis:** Detailed breakdowns of player performance, from the top 10 run-scorers and highest strike rates to the most economical bowlers and top wicket-takers.
* **Team Analysis:** A deep dive into team-level performance, including win rates, and total boundaries (4s and 6s) for each team across the three seasons.
* **Predictions:** A bold attempt at predicting the 2024 season's champions, runners-up, and key award winners, based on the historical data and trends!

This project was a blast to work on and truly demonstrates how business intelligence can turn raw sports data into compelling stories.
